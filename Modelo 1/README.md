# Twitter Hashtags prediction with linear regression

This software implements some linear models with some typical representations for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
in order to predict Twitter hashtags based on text present in tweets. Of course this model needs prior training in 
order to be useful.

Some of the things included in this work is that there is a representation in Bag of Words (Bow) and 
Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), that are solved with a One vs Rest (OvR) classifier
 regularized with logistic regression.

This product is one of various for my thesis project. 

Feel free to use it anytime, and any reference to the original author is welcome! :sunglasses:

## Requirements
The requirements for this model are:
* Python 3.4+
* Numpy 1.13.3+
* Pandas 0.24.2+
* nltk 3.2.5+
* scipy 1.0.0+
* sklearn ??

## Execution
As of today it can not be executed yet, hence it is still under development.

## TODOs
- [ ] Fix execution issues
- [ ] Extend software for CLI use
- [ ] Use of CuPy to push performance :rocket:
